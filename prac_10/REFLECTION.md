# CP1404 Practical Reflection

## Estimates

Regarding the **estimates** that you did for practical tasks...

### How was your estimate accuracy usually?

    Most of the time I was within a more than less within 20 minutes of the actual time. 

### How did your estimate accuracy improve or change during the course of the subject?

    As I gained more experience with the tasks and became familiar with their complexities, my estimates became more realistic.
    Except for assignment 2 gui development that was very wrong. 

### What did you learn from doing these estimates?

    In order to truly know how long something takes to do you would realistically need to have done something remotely similar before. 
    For example doing my first class guitar.py, I didnt really know what I was doing so I gave myself some more time to play around and figure stuff out.
    With that in mind having a better idea that it would take less time I predicted with decent accuracy within 10 minutes how to do most of the other simple classes from there on.

## Code Reviews

### What have you learned from being reviewed by other people?

   Fresh perspectives often reveal overlooked issues and provide good improvements.

### What have you learned from doing code reviews of other people?

    Doing code reviews is relatively challenging.It often took me a lot of timeâ€”usually over an hour per review due to me trying to understand the intent of the code while referencing my own code to see what they did good, what could have been improved and so forth. Despite the lengthy time I feel it improved my ability to think critically about my own. 


### Good Code Review 1

[Code Review 1](https://github.com/DanielNorman47/cp1404practicals/pull/3)

### Explanation

With this subject I only did 3 code reviews (1 happened a few weeks after the task was due) out of the possible 5 which let alot to be desired in getting an idea whether my code reviews were adequate or not. 

I believe this was a good code review due to a few points. I tried to prioritise my feedback on code organisation and readability, due to the person I was reviewing having functioning code which was a bit of a mess. I also tried to improve the way they handled project_management.py in regard to the way they handled saving the file, as well as their naming for some functions. 

### Good Code Review 2

### Explanation

Building on from the prior review I tried to provide examples on where the person I was reviewing went wrong. However because of the limited feeback in regards to code reviews Im unsure if this is good in terms of the crieteria. 

## Practicals

### Regarding the **practical tasks** overall, what would you change if you were in charge of the subject?
    Overall I really enjoyed how the practicals were layed out. My only change id make would tweaking the readme in the prac to show where each deliverable comes from. For example in this prac we were tasked with uploading 4 urls, 2 are self explanitory, 1 of the flask project with modifcations and one of the flask+wiki project. The way I interpretted the Flask + Wikipedia API was that these are the same file ultimately cause you modify the demo unless ive done it wrong. 

### What did you do really well for practicals in this subject?
    Aside from prac01 I feel I did well for the most part of the naming side of practicals as well as the overall structuring of the code.
