# In the same Python file, write statements to achieve the following:

#     Change the first element of numbers to "ten" (the string, not the number 10)
#     Change the last element of numbers to 1
#     Print all the elements from numbers except the first two (slice)
#     Print whether 9 is an element of numbers


# 1.
numbers[0] = "ten"
print(numbers)

# 2.
numbers[-1] = 1
print(numbers)

# 3. 
print(numbers[2:])

# 4.
print(9 in numbers)
