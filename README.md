# CP1404 Practicals

## About This Repository

My name is James, and I’m a second-year Civil Engineering student at James Cook University. I chose CP1404 – Programming II as part of my minor—although I can't exactly remember why, other than thinking it might be fun.

This repository contains my practical work for the subject **CP1404 - Programming II** at James Cook University. 
It includes weekly coding exercises and assignments written in Python, 

### Clean Code 

Throughout this subject, clean code has become a recurring theme (thanks to Lindsay). 
I’ve learned that clean code does the following:
- Has meaningful names, variable names such as, a, variable1, and other meaningless things are pointless if no one can understand whats going on.
- Follows the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): This makes your code modular, easier to debug, and in my opinion easier to understand.
- Does not have magic numbers. Writing MAX_LENGTH = 12 is much clearer than a hard-coded :12 in your strings or loops.
