# CP1404 Practical Reflection

Write short but thoughtful answers to each of the following.  
Replace each `...` with your meaningful answer.

## What have you changed about your process in this subject based on your personal reflection?

By thinking of how im going to do things, before doing them, i feel like im producing easier to follow code than when i first begun in shorter spans of time.

## What do you still need to change in terms of your approach, application, time on task, attitude, etc.?


I Should really try and improve on writing proper docstrings as i go so i dont end up with a "bla bla ble" going into the commit log
it would also help me think of what this function should do to help me adhere better to SRP.

## What are you doing well in the subject so far that you will keep doing?

I feel like im doing good with the naming scheme of things.

## What do you need to stop or change in your work for this subject overall so far?

I should really stop doing most of the lectures in one day, it limits the ability for me to retain the infomation past a few hours of me watching them
which limits my ability to do the practicals without making silly mistakes such as calling methods without () and calling constants with ()

## What is one request you have or change you suggest for this subject and/or your IT degree overall?

I feel mabey this is just because im doing it online, aside from the short seminars and the prerecorded examples there is little time where you can work on 
in class examples/demos and get guided through the thought process. Mabey increasing the seminars to an 1 1/2 could improve that aspect to help develop the invaluable critical thinking skills. But overall i cannot really see anything major or really minor which would want changing.
